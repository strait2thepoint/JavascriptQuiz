# JavascriptQuiz

While building this app, I learned so much more about how to style a page using flexbox and themes.  As a developer, I hoped to come to understand some of the basic ideas behind Javascript.  While I have so much to learn yet, I'm really impressed with the over all functionality of this page.  I used a tutorial to help me build the basic website and the timer I incorporated was from the MSU bootcamp 09-Ins_Timers-Intervals modual.  Part of the challenge was incorporating all of this code into a html & css frame that I built, so it could have my own personal unique style.  
The highscore is saved in local data, which you can access from the inspect console.
